The milestone of developing the Adaptive Dynamic Event Tree (DET) methodology has been fully achieved. The Adaptive Dynamic Event Tree (ADET) module implemented in RAVEN is fully functional and helps RAVEN to become the next generation PRA simulation tool. The developed approach exploits the intrinsic characteristics of the DET methodology, and incorporates these characteristics into the adaptive LS searach concept. The introduction of adaptivity in the determination of the simulation braches allows to improve the trade off between computational time and accuracy in the determination of the limit surface location in the input space. This report shows how the methodology works and how it can be used in a realistic PRA analysis. The coupling of RAVEN and RELAP-7 has been tested in conjunction with this new feature for a demo of a PWR SBO core damage probabilistic analysis. The results have been compared with standard DET approach and show agreement within the prescribed tolerances.

In the future, a more stringent investigation of the theoretical basis will be performed in order to complete the method development.
